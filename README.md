## Quick Start

### Code Projects

```
Read code/discovery/PROCESS.md and help me brainstorm a new project.
Read code/bootstrap/PROCESS.md and create a Python CLI project.
Read code/Coding_Human_AI_Team_Agreement.md and help me get started.
```

See [code/README.md](code/README.md) for full development workflow.

## Shared Resources

- **Personas** (`shared/personas/`) - AI personalities for different tasks
- **Workflows** (`shared/workflows/`) - Cross-domain processes

## Philosophy

Stencils, not scaffolds. These are patterns to trace, not structures to fill. Use them as starting points, adapt freely, discard what doesn't fit.
