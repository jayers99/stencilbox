## Warm Professional

**Best for:** LinkedIn, formal announcements, mixed audiences, situations where you want to be genuine but polished.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Sentence length: Medium, varied. Mix of simple and compound.
- Vocabulary: Accessible but not overly casual. No slang, minimal contractions.
- Punctuation: Periods > exclamation points. Occasional em-dash for emphasis.
- Perspective: First person ("I"), direct address to audience.

**Example phrases that fit:**
- "I'm grateful for..."
- "This wasn't an easy decision."
- "I've learned so much from..."
- "Thank you for being part of..."

**Phrases to avoid:**
- "So excited to announce!" (too corporate-peppy)
- "It's been a wild ride!" (too casual)
- "I'm humbled and honored" (overused, sounds insincere)
- "Bittersweet" (cliche)

**Sample opening:**
> After three wonderful years, I'm moving on from [place]. It's hard to sum up what this time has meant to me, but I want to try.

## Casual Authentic

**Best for:** Instagram, Facebook, close colleagues, friends, situations where personality matters more than polish.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Sentence length: Short to medium. Some fragments okay.
- Vocabulary: Conversational. Contractions welcome. Light slang if it fits.
- Punctuation: Can use ellipses for trailing thoughts... Occasional exclamation okay if genuine.
- Perspective: First person, conversational—like talking to a friend.

**Example phrases that fit:**
- "Okay so..."
- "Here's the thing:"
- "I'm really going to miss..."
- "You guys have been..."
- "Not gonna lie, this is weird to write."

**Phrases to avoid:**
- Formal transitions ("Furthermore," "In conclusion")
- Corporate speak ("leverage," "synergy," "journey")
- Excessive hedging ("I think maybe possibly...")
- Hashtag overload

**Sample opening:**
> Well, this is a weird post to write. After [X years] of [activity], my last day at [place] is [date]. I have a lot of feelings about it.

## Gracious & Brief

**Best for:** Emails to management, announcements to busy people, situations where brevity is respect.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Sentence length: Short. Get to the point.
- Vocabulary: Clear, direct. No fluff.
- Punctuation: Clean. Minimal flourishes.
- Perspective: First person, matter-of-fact.

**Example phrases that fit:**
- "Wanted to let you know—"
- "My last day is [date]."
- "Thank you for [specific thing]."
- "I appreciate [specific person or thing]."

**Phrases to avoid:**
- Long preambles ("I've been thinking a lot about...")
- Excessive gratitude stacking
- Anything that could be cut without losing meaning

**Sample opening:**
> My last day at [place] is [date]. I wanted you to hear it from me directly.

## Nostalgic Storyteller

**Best for:** Long-tenure departures, close relationships, emotional moments, when the story matters.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Sentence length: Varied, with some longer sentences for flow.
- Vocabulary: Evocative, sensory. Paint pictures.
- Punctuation: Em-dashes, ellipses for pacing. Paragraphs can breathe.
- Perspective: First person, reflective. Looking back.

**Example phrases that fit:**
- "I still remember the first time..."
- "There's this moment that keeps coming back to me..."
- "If you'd told me [X years ago]..."
- "What I'll carry with me is..."

**Phrases to avoid:**
- Rushing to the point (let the story land)
- Generic memories ("good times")
- Over-explaining the lesson ("And that's when I learned...")

**Sample opening:**
> The first time I walked behind that bar, I dropped a full tray of glasses within ten minutes. [Regular's name] just laughed and said, "We've all been there." That's the thing about this place—

## Community Voice

**Best for:** Writing *about* someone (tributes, farewell posts from a group, celebrating a person). Third-person perspective honoring someone else.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Sentence length: Varied. Short punchy observations mixed with flowing appreciation.
- Vocabulary: Specific and sensory. Name names, cite details only insiders would know.
- Punctuation: Dashes for asides, periods for weight. Restrained exclamations.
- Perspective: Third person or collective "we." The community speaking, not the individual.

**Example phrases that fit:**
- "If you've ever been to [place], you know [person]."
- "She's the one who..."
- "You could always count on..."
- "What you might not know is..."
- "We're losing someone who..."

**Phrases to avoid:**
- Generic praise ("amazing person," "will be missed")
- Speaking *for* the person ("She would want you to know...")
- Overly formal eulogy tone (save that for funerals)
- Vague superlatives without specifics

**Key technique:** Ground every compliment in a concrete detail.
- Weak: "She made everyone feel welcome."
- Strong: "She remembered your drink, your kid's name, and which team you hated."

**Sample opening:**
> If you've spent a Friday night at the Flatiron, you know Jessica. She's the one with the red Chucks, the reggae playlist, and the Tic Tac shots she'd share when you least expected it.

## Mixing Tones

Most real writing blends tones. Common combinations:

| Blend | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Warm Professional + Casual Authentic** | Social media where you want heart but not sloppiness |
| **Nostalgic Storyteller + Gracious Brief** | Open with a memory, then get to the point |
| **Casual Authentic + Gracious Brief** | Texts to friends—warm but not drawn out |
| **Community Voice + Nostalgic Storyteller** | Tributes that paint a picture over time |
| **Community Voice + Casual Authentic** | Group posts that feel like friends talking, not a press release |
