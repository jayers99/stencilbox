# Interview Questions Framework

A guide for crafting interview questions that surface rich, specific material for writing projects.

## Core Principles

### 1. Specificity Over Generality

Bad questions invite vague answers. Good questions demand details.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "What do you like about her?" | "What's something she does that nobody else does?" |
| "How would you describe him?" | "If you had to cast an actor to play him, who would it be and why?" |
| "What will you miss?" | "What's a small thing she does that you'll suddenly notice is gone?" |

### 2. Sensory and Concrete

Push for things you can see, hear, smell, taste, or touch.

- "What does it sound like when she's behind the bar?"
- "Describe what you see when you walk in on a Friday night."
- "What's the first thing you'd notice if you walked in tomorrow and she wasn't there?"

### 3. Story-Shaped Questions

Ask for moments, not summaries.

- "Tell me about a time when..."
- "What's the first memory that comes to mind?"
- "If there were one scene that captured who she is, what would it be?"

### 4. The Contrast Technique

Ask what makes this person/place different from alternatives.

- "What's different about this place compared to other bars you go to?"
- "What does she do that other bartenders don't?"
- "What would be missing if she weren't here?"

### 5. Permission to Be Specific

People often self-censor interesting details. Give them permission.

- "This might sound small, but..."
- "Even if it seems silly..."
- "What's an inside joke or detail only regulars would know?"

## Question Categories

### About a Person

**Character & Presence:**
- How would you describe them to someone who's never met them?
- If you had to cast an actor to play them, who would it be?
- What's their energy like when they walk into a room?
- Three words that capture who they are?

**Signature Details:**
- What's something they always do/say/wear?
- Any rituals or routines they're known for?
- What's their "thing" - the detail regulars would recognize?

**Relationships:**
- Who are they closest to here?
- How do they make people feel?
- What's a moment you saw them really connect with someone?

**Stories & Moments:**
- Tell me about a time they went above and beyond.
- What's the funniest thing you've seen them do?
- What's a moment that captures who they are?
- When did you first realize they were special?

**Impact:**
- What will be different without them?
- What did they teach you, even indirectly?
- What's something small they do that makes a big difference?

### About a Place

**First Impressions:**
- What do you notice when you first walk in?
- How would you describe it to someone who's never been?
- What makes it different from other [bars/offices/etc.]?

**Sensory Details:**
- What does it smell/sound/feel like?

- What's the flow of a day look like?

**Community:**
- Who are the regulars?
- What brings people together here?
- What's an inside joke only insiders would get?

### About a Transition/Departure

**The Emotional Core:**
- What will you miss most?
- What's the deeper loss here beyond the practical?
- How does this feel - not what you think, but how it feels?

**Looking Back:**
- What's your earliest memory of [person/place]?
- How has it changed since you first arrived?
- What's a moment you'll always remember?

**Looking Forward:**
- What do you hope happens next?
- What do you want [person] to know before they go?
- How will you remember this?

## Interview Flow

### Warm-Up (2-3 min)
Start easy. Build rapport before asking emotional questions.
- "How long have you been coming here?"
- "How did you first meet [person]?"

### Core Questions (10-15 min)
Go deeper. Use follow-ups: "Tell me more about that." "What do you mean by...?"

### The Dig (5 min)
Push for the specific, the surprising, the unsaid.
- "What's something people might not know?"
- "Is there a detail you've been holding back because it seemed too small?"

### Close (2 min)
- "Anything else you want to add?"
- "Is there anything I should have asked but didn't?"

## Capturing Good Material

**During the interview:**
- Write down exact phrases (quotable moments)
- Note body language, pauses, emotion
- Don't over-edit in real time - capture raw

**Immediately after:**
- Star the best 3-5 quotes
- Note unexpected details
- Write one sentence: "The heart of this interview was..."

## Adapting Questions

When creating project-specific interview prompts:

1. Start with this framework's categories
2. Customize with proper nouns (names, places, specific details)
3. Add context-specific questions based on your brainstorm
4. Remove categories that don't apply
5. Keep it short enough to actually use (10-15 questions max)

*See your project folder for customized interview prompts.*
