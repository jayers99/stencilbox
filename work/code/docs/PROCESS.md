# Delivery Process (Work-Safe)

Framework for planning, implementing, and delivering within JPMC policies.

- Requirements: use `docs/templates/requirements.md` adapted for compliance.
- Design: capture decisions in `docs/templates/adr.md`.
- Backlog: maintain in approved tracker; mirror high-level in repo.
- Reviews: enforce required sign-offs and automated checks.
- Release: document change tickets and rollout plans.
