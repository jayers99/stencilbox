need to spend more time on the stories.  get acctp right.
find out what the plan mode is

i should add that frequent commits are made
i should add not to start building right a way
it should read in requirements doc
it should get description and those other questions from the design doc
we should iterate on the design doc then make rodemap
jira and bitbucket patterns
agile/wip
story points
each story is 3 to 5 points and should be able to be coded with unit and integration test and uat tested as final step for merg
use copilot agent up on github to review all PR
when copilot finished with review claude code should review all the comments and either fix or ignore but comment inline on each saying what it chose to do
branches should follow the jira/bitbucket style. with feature/bla and bugfix/bla
when generating requrements and breaking down stories into good tickets
tickets and stories should have concreate acceptance requirements and those should be have unit, integration, and uat testing.
each pr should include a set of uat testing instructions

spike tickets
can i config github so i can approve PR
limit prompts to pr approval after story finished
wait for integration testing before next story
it should write the integration tests and provide instructions to run
it should update the user doc as we go
need to try out it reading comments and issues with pr process
or just interact with cli and have it add that to pr
i want it to sound a beep notification when it's ready for PR
i wish it could detect when i merged commit
once a project is over what's the best way to return to it or bug fix and feature adds
how do i ask where it's at in the plan?
could not figure how how to get claude to reply to the copilot PR Changes
lets put requirements in markdown and put a semver in the doc and leave file name the same

project boot strap
create repo
commands to allow
