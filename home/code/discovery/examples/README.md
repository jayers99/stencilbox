# Discovery Examples

This directory contains example outputs from the discovery process. These are reference materials to show what completed discovery artifacts look like.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `brainstorm.md` | Example brain dump from Step 1 of discovery process |
| `problem-statement.md` | Example refined problem definition from Step 2 |
| `validation.md` | Example risk analysis and validation from Step 3 |
| `mvp-scope.md` | Example MVP scope definition from Step 4 |

## Usage

These are **examples only** and should not be edited. When you run the discovery process in your own project:

1. Create a `discovery/` folder in your project directory
2. Generate your own versions of these files using the process in `../PROCESS.md`
3. Your files should live in your project, not in this templates repository
