## Home-Specific Notes

For personal projects, design docs:
- Can be lightweight sketches rather than formal specifications
- Focus on "what I need to remember" rather than "what I need to communicate"
- Are great for thinking through complex features before coding
- Can be created by AI from your verbal description

## When to Create

Create a design doc when:
- A feature touches multiple components or modules
- You're unsure which approach to take
- The implementation will take more than one session
- You want to document your architecture for future reference

## Quick Start

Ask AI: *"Draft a design doc for [feature]. Keep it lightweight—I just need the key decisions documented."*
