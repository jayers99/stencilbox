## Home-Specific Notes

For personal projects, requirements can be:
- More fluid and evolving than formal specs
- Written in your own voice, not corporate language
- Focused on the MVP and what you'll actually build
- Created iteratively as you learn more

## Creating Requirements with AI

1. Start with discovery phase outputs (problem statement, MVP scope)
2. Ask AI: *"Turn my MVP scope into a requirements doc"*
3. Review and refine the generated requirements
4. Link requirements to stories as you create them

## Tips

- Keep the "Must Have" list small—MVP means minimum
- Don't over-specify—leave room for iteration
- Update requirements as you learn during implementation
- Use requirements to stay focused when scope creeps
