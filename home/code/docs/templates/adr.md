## Home-Specific Notes

For personal projects, ADRs can be:
- More informal and conversational
- Focused on learning and experimentation
- Used to document "why I chose X" for future reference
- Created retroactively when documenting decisions made

## Quick Use

When AI asks: *"Should I create an ADR for this decision?"*, say yes if:
- The decision affects architecture or major dependencies
- You might forget why you chose this approach
- The decision has interesting trade-offs worth documenting
