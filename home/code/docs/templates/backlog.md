## Home-Specific Notes

For personal projects:
- **WIP Limit: 1** - Focus on one story at a time
- **Informal tracking** - Don't over-engineer the backlog
- **Priority by instinct** - Trust your gut on what to work on next
- **Flexible process** - Adapt the workflow to your needs

## AI Instructions

When starting a session, AI should:
1. Read BACKLOG.md to understand current status
2. If asked "What should we work on?", suggest the top Ready item
3. Update the backlog as work progresses
4. Move completed items to CHANGELOG.md during release preparation
