# Learning Human-AI Team Agreement

A workflow for developing programming skills with AI assistance - becoming a stronger developer as AI capabilities grow.

## 1. The Goal

Transform from "person who uses AI to code" into "programmer who leverages AI effectively."

The difference: understanding *why* code works, not just *that* it works.

## 2. Collaboration Model

**Human responsibilities:**
- Do the hard thinking (AI assists, doesn't replace)
- Attempt problems before asking for help
- Explain solutions back in your own words
- Track progress and identify gaps
- Practice deliberately, not passively

**AI responsibilities:**
- Teach concepts, not just give answers
- Ask guiding questions before revealing solutions
- Explain the "why" behind approaches
- Provide increasingly challenging problems
- Give honest assessment of understanding

## 3. Learning Modes

### Mode: Teach Me
- AI explains concepts from fundamentals
- Uses analogies and examples
- Checks understanding with questions
- Builds from simple to complex

### Mode: Challenge Me
- AI presents problems at appropriate difficulty
- Hints available on request (graduated)
- Solution review after attempt
- Identifies patterns and techniques

### Mode: Review My Work
- Human submits code/solution
- AI analyzes approach, not just correctness
- Points out improvements
- Compares to alternative approaches

### Mode: Debug Together
- Human explains what they expected vs. got
- AI asks diagnostic questions
- Guides toward discovery, doesn't just fix
- Teaches debugging methodology

### Mode: Explain This
- Human shares code they don't understand
- AI walks through line by line
- Connects to concepts Human knows
- Identifies what to study further

## 4. The Learning Protocol

### Before Asking AI for Help

1. **Spend 15-25 minutes stuck** - Struggle is where learning happens
2. **Articulate the problem** - Write out what you're trying to do
3. **List what you've tried** - Forces you to think systematically
4. **Identify the specific gap** - "I don't understand X" not "it doesn't work"

### When Getting Help

1. **Ask for hints first** - "Give me a hint about approach"
2. **Ask for concepts** - "What technique applies here?"
3. **Ask for partial solutions** - "Show me just the structure"
4. **Full solution last resort** - And then explain it back

### After Getting Help

1. **Implement it yourself** - Don't copy-paste
2. **Explain it in your words** - If you can't, you don't understand
3. **Solve a similar problem** - Apply the concept fresh
4. **Log what you learned** - Build your knowledge base

## 5. Skill Areas

### Problem Solving
- Breaking problems into subproblems
- Recognizing patterns
- Working through examples by hand
- Testing edge cases
- Time/space complexity thinking

### Fundamentals
- Data structures (when to use what)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, graphs, DP)
- Design patterns
- System design basics
- Language-specific idioms

### Practical Skills
- Reading unfamiliar code
- Debugging systematically
- Writing testable code
- Code review (giving and receiving)
- Documentation

## 6. Progress Tracking

### Weekly Reflection (journal/)

```markdown
## Week of [Date]

### What I Learned
- [Concept/technique]
- [Concept/technique]

### Problems Solved
- [Problem] - [Key insight]
- [Problem] - [Key insight]

### Struggled With
- [Topic] - [What's still unclear]

### Next Week Focus
- [Specific goal]
```

### Skill Assessment (quarterly)

Rate yourself 1-5:

| Skill | Rating | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Problem decomposition | | |
| Pattern recognition | | |
| Data structure selection | | |
| Algorithm implementation | | |
| Debugging | | |
| Code reading | | |
| Testing | | |

## 7. Difficulty Progression

**Level 1: Guided**
- AI provides structure
- Step-by-step hints available
- Focus on syntax and basics

**Level 2: Supported**
- AI provides problem only
- Hints on request
- Focus on approach selection

**Level 3: Independent**
- Real-world ambiguous problems
- Minimal hints
- Focus on problem formulation

**Level 4: Teaching**
- Explain concepts to AI
- AI plays confused student
- You're not fluent until you can teach it

## 8. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Copy-paste solutions | No learning happens | Type it yourself, understand each line |
| Asking AI first | Skips the struggle | 15-25 min attempt first |
| "Make it work" | Hides understanding gaps | "Help me understand why..." |
| Skipping fundamentals | Fragile knowledge | Build from basics up |
| Only easy problems | No growth | Push just past comfortable |
| No review | Mistakes repeat | Reflect on what you learned |

## 9. Session Starters

**For learning a concept:**
```
Teach me [concept] from first principles.
Start simple, build up complexity.
Check my understanding as we go.
```

**For problem practice:**
```
Give me a [difficulty] problem involving [topic].
Don't give hints unless I ask.
After I attempt, review my approach.
```

**For code review:**
```
Review this code for:
- Correctness
- Efficiency
- Readability
- What I might be missing

[paste code]
```

**For debugging:**
```
I'm stuck on this bug.
Expected: [X]
Getting: [Y]
I've tried: [list]

Ask me questions to help me find it.
```

## 10. File Organization

```
learning/
├── problem-solving/    # Exercises, patterns, approaches
├── fundamentals/       # CS concepts, study notes
└── journal/            # Weekly reflections, progress logs
```

## 11. The Commitment

Learning to program well takes time. AI can accelerate it, but can't skip it.

**Daily:** 30+ minutes of deliberate practice
**Weekly:** Reflection and planning
**Monthly:** Skill assessment and adjustment

The goal isn't to finish a syllabus. It's to build durable skills that make you valuable regardless of how AI evolves.

**The rule:** If AI disappears tomorrow, could you still solve the problem? If not, you haven't learned it yet.
