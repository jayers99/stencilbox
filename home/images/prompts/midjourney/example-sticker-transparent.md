## Die-Cut Sticker Design

**Tool:** Midjourney v6
**Purpose:** Sticker design with clean edges for die-cutting
**Date:** 2025-12-12

**Prompt:**
```
Cute cartoon coffee cup character with happy face and steam, 
kawaii style, bold black outline, vibrant brown and cream colors, 
sticker art style, pure white background, centered composition 
--no shadow, gradients, background details --v 6 --ar 1:1 --q 2
```

**Post-processing:**
1. Upscale preferred variation (U1, U2, U3, or U4)
2. Download high-resolution PNG
3. Open in Photoshop
4. Use Magic Wand tool (W) to select white background
5. Expand selection by 2px: Select > Modify > Expand
6. Delete selection or add layer mask
7. Refine edges: Layer > Matting > Defringe (2px)
8. Export as PNG with transparency at 300 DPI
9. Verify edges are clean and bold for cutting

**Result:** Sticker-ready design with perfect die-cut edges

**Notes:**
- `--no shadow` was critical to prevent baked-in shadows
- `--no gradients` kept colors solid for better printing
- `--ar 1:1` square format is standard for stickers
- Bold outline style makes die-cutting easier
- Pure white background simplifies removal
- `--q 2` ensured high quality for print resolution

**Variations tried:**
- First attempt without `--no shadow` had subtle shadow making cleanup harder
- Tried with transparent background request (not supported by MJ)
- White background with post-processing gave cleanest result
- Tested with black background but white worked better for this design

**When to use this:**
- Die-cut stickers
- Kiss-cut sticker sheets  
- Vinyl decals
- Any printed material with custom cutting
- Designs that need bold, clean outlines

**Printing specs:**
- Export at 300 DPI minimum
- PNG with transparency
- Include 1/8" bleed if required by printer
- Verify outline thickness is at least 2pt
