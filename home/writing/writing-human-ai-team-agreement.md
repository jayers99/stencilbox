# Writing Human-AI Team Agreement

A workflow for collaborative writing - fiction, nonfiction, and creative projects.

## 1. Collaboration Model

**Human responsibilities:**
- Provide creative vision and voice
- Make story/structural decisions
- Final editorial judgment
- Maintain authenticity and personal perspective

**AI responsibilities:**
- Generate drafts and variations
- Suggest structure and organization
- Offer alternative phrasings
- Catch inconsistencies and gaps
- Research and fact-checking support

## 2. Writing Modes

### Mode: Brainstorm
- AI generates many ideas quickly
- No judgment, quantity over quality
- Human picks threads to pull

### Mode: Draft
- AI writes based on direction
- Human provides outline or bullet points
- Output is raw material, not finished work

### Mode: Refine
- AI improves existing Human text
- Preserve voice, fix mechanics
- "Make this clearer" not "rewrite this"

### Mode: Edit
- AI acts as editor, not writer
- Suggests changes, doesn't make them
- Focuses on structure, flow, clarity

### Mode: Research
- AI gathers information
- Summarizes sources
- Human synthesizes into their own words

## 3. Voice Preservation

**To maintain your voice:**

1. **Provide samples** - Give AI examples of your writing
2. **Specify what NOT to do** - "Don't use corporate jargon", "No exclamation points"
3. **Edit heavily** - AI drafts are clay, you're the sculptor
4. **Read aloud** - If it doesn't sound like you, revise

**Voice anchors to define:**
- Sentence length preference (short/varied/long)
- Vocabulary level (simple/technical/literary)
- Tone (casual/formal/irreverent)
- Perspective (first person/third/omniscient)

## 4. Workflow by Type

### Fiction

**Phase 1: Concept**
- Premise, theme, "what if"
- Character sketches
- World rules

**Phase 2: Structure**
- Plot beats / outline
- Scene list
- Character arcs

**Phase 3: Draft**
- Scene by scene
- AI can draft, Human revises
- Or Human drafts, AI suggests

**Phase 4: Revise**
- Consistency pass
- Voice pass
- Line editing

### Nonfiction

**Phase 1: Research**
- Gather sources
- Outline key points
- Identify gaps

**Phase 2: Structure**
- Logical flow
- Section breakdown
- Key takeaways

**Phase 3: Draft**
- Section by section
- Human expertise + AI organization
- Fact-check as you go

**Phase 4: Polish**
- Clarity pass
- Remove jargon
- Add examples

### Short-Form (posts, copy, emails)

1. Human provides: purpose, audience, key points
2. AI drafts 2-3 variations
3. Human picks and edits
4. Quick iteration if needed

## 5. Quality Standards

**Good writing from this collaboration:**
- [ ] Sounds like Human wrote it
- [ ] Achieves its purpose
- [ ] Clear and concise
- [ ] No AI-isms ("delve", "straightforward", "it's important to note")
- [ ] Factually accurate

**AI-isms to remove:**
- "Let's dive in"
- "In conclusion"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "Firstly, secondly, thirdly"
- Excessive hedging ("might", "could potentially")
- Bullet points where prose works better

## 6. Feedback Protocol

**Effective feedback:**
- "This paragraph is too long, break it up"
- "The transition from X to Y is jarring"
- "This sounds too formal for the audience"
- "I like the structure, but the examples are weak"

**Ineffective feedback:**
- "Make it better"
- "This doesn't feel right"
- "Try again"

**When stuck, try:**
- "Give me 3 different approaches to this section"
- "What's the core point I'm trying to make here?"
- "How would [author/publication] write this?"

## 7. Iteration Limits

| Type | Max Iterations |
|------|----------------|
| Brainstorm | Until you have enough raw material |
| Single paragraph | 3 rounds |
| Full draft | 2 major revisions |
| Line edits | 1 pass |

If you're past these limits, the problem is direction, not execution. Step back and clarify what you actually want.

## 8. File Organization

```
writing/
├── fiction/          # Story structures, character sheets, world-building
├── nonfiction/       # Article templates, research frameworks
└── prompts/          # Reusable writing prompts and instructions
```

## 9. Session Starters

**For fiction:**
```
I'm working on [genre] story about [premise].
The tone is [tone]. Think [comparable work].
Today I want to [specific task].
```

**For nonfiction:**
```
I'm writing [type] for [audience] about [topic].
The goal is to [desired outcome].
My key points are: [bullets]
```

**For editing:**
```
Review this for [specific concerns].
Preserve my voice - don't rewrite, just flag issues.
[paste text]
```

## 10. Collaboration Boundaries

**AI should:**
- Generate options
- Organize ideas
- Improve clarity
- Catch errors

**AI should NOT:**
- Make creative decisions without approval
- Override Human voice preferences
- Add content Human didn't ask for
- Pad word count

**The rule:** Human decides what to say. AI helps say it well.
