# Farewell Communication Framework

A reusable structure for crafting goodbye announcements when leaving a job, community, or role.

## Before You Write

### 1. Define Your Audience

| Audience | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| **Social media (public)** | Wider reach, less personal detail, think about who might see it unexpectedly |
| **Close colleagues/regulars** | Can be more personal, specific memories welcome |
| **Management/formal** | Professional tone, focus on gratitude and transition |
| **Group chat/text** | Casual, can include inside jokes or shorthand |

**Ask:** Who absolutely needs to hear this? Who might feel hurt if they learn secondhand?

### 2. Decide What to Share

- **Timeline:** Last day, any "come say goodbye" dates
- **Reason:** Are you comfortable sharing why? (New opportunity, life change, just time to move on)
- **What's next:** Mention it, keep it vague, or skip entirely
- **Contact info:** How can people stay in touch, if at all?

## Key Elements Checklist

A strong farewell typically includes:

- [ ] **Clear announcement** - Don't bury the lead. "I'm leaving [place]" early.
- [ ] **Timeline** - When is your last day?
- [ ] **Specific gratitude** - Name names, recall moments. "Thank you for everything" lands flat.
- [ ] **What you'll miss** - Shows authenticity, not just obligation
- [ ] **How to connect** - If appropriate: social handle, "you know where to find me", etc.
- [ ] **Call to action** - "Come see me before [date]" or "Stop by Thursday"

### Optional Elements

- What's next (if you want to share)
- A specific memory or moment that captures the experience
- Light humor (if it fits your voice)

## What to Avoid

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Burn bridges** | Even if you're leaving for bad reasons, keep it classy. You never know. |
| **Over-explain** | "I'm leaving because..." followed by 3 paragraphs. Keep it simple. |
| **Generic platitudes** | "It's been a journey" says nothing. Be specific or cut it. |
| **False promises** | "Let's definitely hang out!" - only if you mean it |
| **Apologize for leaving** | You're allowed to move on. Don't start with "I'm sorry to announce..." |
| **Make it about drama** | Save grievances for your journal or therapist |

## Structure Templates

### For Social Media (Instagram, Facebook)

```
[Opening hook - announce the news]
[1-2 sentences of specific gratitude or memory]
[What you'll miss]
[Timeline - last day or "come say goodbye"]
[How to stay connected]
```

### For Personal Text/Message

```
[Direct announcement - they deserve to hear it from you]
[Why you're telling them specifically]
[Specific memory or appreciation for them]
[Logistics - when, where to see you]
```

### For Formal/Professional

```
[Announcement with timeline]
[Gratitude for opportunity]
[Brief transition notes if relevant]
[Professional well-wishes]
```

## Interview Questions (for gathering material)

If writing for someone else, ask:

**Basics:**
- When is your last day?
- How long have you been there?
- Who needs to hear this and how?

**The Place (Setting & Atmosphere):**
- Describe the physical space - what makes it distinctive?
- Any quirky details? (Old fixtures, inside jokes on the walls, signature decor)
- What does it smell/sound/feel like there?
- What would a first-time visitor notice?

**Signature Rituals & Details:**
- Any traditions or routines you're known for?
- A signature drink, dish, phrase, or gesture?
- Small touches that are "so you" - things regulars would recognize?
- Playlists, uniforms, handwriting, decorations you're responsible for?

**Cast of Characters:**
- Who are the key people in this story? (Coworkers, regulars, mentors)
- Any relationships worth naming specifically?
- Inside jokes or nicknames?
- Who will miss you most, and why?

**Emotional Core:**
- What will you miss most?
- What's the deeper theme here? (Found family, end of an era, bittersweet growth)
- How do you want to be remembered?
- If this were a movie scene, what moment would capture it?

**Practical:**
- Do you want people to come say goodbye?
- How can people stay in touch?
- Anything you definitely don't want mentioned?

**Optional:**
- Why are you leaving? (Okay to skip)
- What's next? (Okay to skip)

## Gathering Community Voices (Optional)

For richer announcements, consider collecting input from others:

**Patron/colleague interview prompts:**
- "What's your favorite memory of [person]?"
- "What will you miss most?"
- "Describe [person] in three words."
- "What's something [person] does that nobody else does?"

**How to use community input:**
- Weave quotes into the announcement
- Create a "comment cascade" - seed responses that prompt others to share
- Use details from others to surprise the person being honored

## Example Openings by Tone

| Tone | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Warm & sincere** | "It's hard to write this, but after [X years], I'm saying goodbye to [place]." |
| **Light & casual** | "Well, this is a weird post to write. My last day at [place] is [date]." |
| **Direct & brief** | "My last shift at [place] is [date]. Wanted you to hear it from me." |
| **Nostalgic** | "The first time I walked in here, I had no idea what I was doing..." |
